# Bolt Proc Counter

This plugin tracks your attacks, procs and rate of bolts procs.
There is options to separate Armadyl/Zaryte cross bow special attacks from the normal counter.
You must have sounds enabled for the plugin to track ruby bolt procs.

For bolts effects that dont bypass accuracy check, the plugin assumes 100% accuracy for expected rates tracking.
